We have seen this morning how to build Kriging models and what are the assumptions they rely on. We get into more details:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item it is straightforward to change the prior belief
  \item parameters can be included in models to get a better fit between prior belief and data
  \item one must \textbf{validate} a model before using it!
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Kernels}
%\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
For a given set of observations, the model is fully determined by the prior covariance function $k(x,y) = \Cov[Z(x),Z(y)]$:
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    m(x) &= k(x,X) k(X,X)^{-1} F \\
    v(x) &= k(x,x) - k(x,X) k(X,X)^{-1} k(X,x)
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
A kernel satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is symmetric: $k(x,y) = k(y,x)$
  \item It is positive semi-definite (psd):
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
  \forall n \in \mathds{N}, \forall x_i \in D, \forall \alpha \in \mathds{R}^n,\  \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j k(x_i,x_j) \geq 0
\end{equation*}
\vspace{5mm} \\
Furthermore any symmetric psd function can be seen as the covariance of a Gaussian process.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Proving that a function is psd is often intractable. However there are a lot of functions that have already been proven to be psd:\\
\vspace{2mm}
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{rlN}
    squared exp. & $\displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \exp \left(- \frac{(x-y)^2}{2 \theta^2} \right)$ &\\[4mm]
    Matern 5/2 & $\displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{5}|x-y|}{\theta} + \frac{5|x-y|^2}{3 \theta^2} \right) \exp \left(- \frac{\sqrt{5}|x-y|}{\theta} \right)$ &\\[4mm]
    Matern 3/2 & $\displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}|x-y|}{\theta} \right) \exp \left(- \frac{\sqrt{3}|x-y|}{\theta} \right)$ &\\[4mm]
    exponential & $\displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \exp \left(- \frac{|x-y|}{\theta} \right)$ &\\[4mm]
    Brownian & $ \displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \min (x,y) $ &\\[4mm]
    white noise & $ \displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \delta_{x,y} $ &\\[4mm]
    constant & $ \displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 $ &\\[4mm]
    linear & $ \displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 xy $ &\\[4mm]
\end{tabular}
\vspace{2mm}
\normalsize
When $k$ is a function of $x-y$, the kernel is called \textbf{stationary}.\\
$\sigma^2$ is called the \textbf{variance} and $\theta$ the \textbf{lengthscale}.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Changing kernel means changing the prior belief on $f$\\

\includegraphics[height=3.8cm]{figures/R/Fig2-sim-rbf} \qquad 
\includegraphics[height=3.8cm]{figures/R/Fig2-sim-exp}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
It thus has \alert{a huge impact on the model}:\\

\includegraphics[height=3.9cm]{figures/R/Fig2-GP-rbf} \qquad 
\includegraphics[height=3.9cm]{figures/R/Fig2-GP-exp}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
There is no model/kernel that is intrinsically better... it depends on the data! \\
\vspace{5mm}
The kernel has to be chosen accordingly to our prior belief on the behaviour of the function to study:
\begin{itemize}
  \item is it continuous, differentiable, how many times?
  \item is it stationary ?
  \item ...
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
Furthermore, it is possible to introduce rescaling parameters to adjust the prior distribution to our belief.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
For $d \geq 2$, there can be one rescaling parameter per dimension:
\begin{equation*}
  \Ni{x-y}{\theta} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{(x_i-y_i)^2}{\theta_i^2} \right)^{1/2}.
\end{equation*}
\vspace{2mm}
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{rlN}
        squared exp. & $\displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \exp \left(- \frac12 \Ni{x-y}{\theta}^2 \right)$ &\\[6mm]
        Matern 5/2 & $\displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \left(1 + \sqrt{5}\Ni{x-y}{\theta} + \frac{5}{3}\Ni{x-y}{\theta}^2 \right) \exp \left(- \sqrt{5}\Ni{x-y}{\theta} \right)$ &\\[6mm]
        Matern 3/2 & $\displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \left(1 + \sqrt{3}\Ni{x-y}{\theta} \right) \exp \left(- \sqrt{3}\Ni{x-y}{\theta}  \right)$ &\\[6mm]
        exponential & $\displaystyle k(x,y) = \sigma^2 \exp \left(- \Ni{x-y}{\theta} \right)$ 
\end{tabular}
\normalsize
\\ \vspace{5mm} \
If all $\theta_i$ are equal, we say that the kernel/process is \textbf{isotropic}.
\end{frame}

\section[Param Estim]{Parameter estimation}
%\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We have seen previously that the choice of the kernel and its parameters have a great influence on the model. \\ \vspace{5mm}
In order to choose a prior that is suited to the data at hand, we can consider:
\begin{itemize}
  \item minimising the model error
  \item Using maximum likelihood estimation 
\end{itemize}
We will now detail the second one.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The likelihood quantifies the adequacy between a distribution and some observations. 
\begin{definition}
Let $f_Y$ be a pdf depending on some parameters $p$ and let $y_1,\dots,y_n$ be independent observations. The \textbf{likelihood} is defined as 
\begin{equation*}
  L(p) = \prod_{i=1}^n f_Y(y_i;p).
\end{equation*} 
\end{definition}
A high value of $L(p)$ indicates the observations are likely to be drawn from $f_Y(.;p)$.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
In the GPR context, we often have only \textbf{one observation} of the vector $F$. The likelihood is then:
\footnotesize
\begin{equation*}
  L(\sigma^2,\theta)= f_{Z(X)}(F;\sigma^2,\theta) = \frac{1}{\displaystyle | 2 \pi k(X,X)|^{1/2}} \exp \left(-\frac12 F^t k(X,X)^{-1} F  \right).
\end{equation*} 
\normalsize
It is thus possible to maximise $L$  with respect to the kernel's parameters in order to find a well suited prior.\\
\vspace{5mm}
In practice, %it is common to work with the concentrated log-likelihood:
% \begin{equation*}
%   \ell (\sigma^2, \theta) =  \log(|k(X,X)|) + F^t k(X,X)^{-1} F
% \end{equation*} 
% T
the value of $\sigma^2$ can be obtained analytically. Others, such as $\theta$, need numerical optimization.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
\begin{example}
  We consider 100 sample from a  Mat\'ern 5/2 process with parameters $\sigma^2=1$ and $\theta = 0.2$, and $n$ observation points. We then try to recover the kernel parameters using MLE.\\ \vspace{5mm}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|cccc|}
    \hline
    $n$ & 5 & 10 & 15 & 20 \\ \hline
    $\sigma^2$ & 1.0 (0.7) & 1.11 (0.71) & 1.03 (0.73) & 0.88 (0.60) \\
    $\theta$ & 0.20 (0.13) & 0.21 (0.07) & 0.20 (0.04) & 0.19 (0.03) \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{example}
\vspace{5mm}
MLE can be applied regardless to the dimension of the input space.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Model validation}
%\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We have seen that given some observations $F=f(X)$, it is very easy to build lots of models, either by changing the kernel parameters or the kernel itself.\\ 
\vspace{5mm}
The interesting question is how to get a good model:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is a good model?
  \item How to measure it?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The idea is to compare the model predictions with real values on new data. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{figures/R/VALID_testset}
\end{center}
\vspace{3mm}
Since GPR models provide a mean and a covariance structure for the error they both have to be assessed.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Let $X_t$ be the test set and $F_t=f(X_t)$ be the associated observations.\\ \vspace{5mm}
The accuracy of the mean can be measured by computing: 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \text{Mean Square Error\qquad}& MSE = \mathrm{mean} ((F_t - m(X_t))^2) \\
    \text{A ``normalised'' criterion\qquad}& Q_2 = 1 - \frac{\sum (F_t - m(X_t))^2}{\sum (F_t - \mathrm{mean}(F_t))^2} 
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
\\ \ \\
On the above example we get $MSE = 0.038$ and $Q_2 = 0.95$.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The predicted distribution can be tested by normalising the residuals. \\ \vspace{3mm}
According to the model, $F_t \sim \mathcal{N}(m(X_t),c(X_t,X_t))$.\\ \vspace{3mm}
$c(X_t,X_t)^{-1/2}(F_t-m(X_t)) $ should thus be independents $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/VALID_hist} \qquad
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/VALID_qqplot}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
When no test set is available, another option is to consider cross validation methods such as leave-one-out. \\ \vspace{5mm}
The steps are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[1.] build a model based on all observations except one
  \item[2.] compute the model error at this point
\end{enumerate}
This procedure can be repeated for all the design points in order to get a vector of error.
\end{frame}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/R/VALID_crossval3}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
On this example, we obtain $MSE = 0.24$ and $Q_2 = 0.34$. \\ \vspace{3mm} 
\begin{center}
\structure{Why doesn't the model perform as good previously?}
\end{center}

\pause
\vspace{5mm}
It turns out that the error is always computed at the `worst' location!
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We can also look at the residual distribution. For leave-one-out, there is no joint distribution for the residuals so they have to be standardised independently. We obtain: 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/VALID_crossvalhist} \qquad
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/VALID_crossvalqqplot}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Trends}
%\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We have seen that GPR models go back to zero if we consider a centred prior. \\ \vspace{5mm} This behaviour is not always wanted
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/trend_pb2}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We may want to introduce some trend in models... One can distinguish:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{simple kriging}: there is no trend or it is known
	\item \textbf{ordinary kriging}: the trend is a constant
	\item \textbf{universal kriging}: the trend is given by basis functions
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm} 
The question is how to estimate the trend coefficients. Hereafter, we will focus on ordinary kriging and write $t$ the mean value.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Basic least squares minimization gives
$$ \displaystyle \hat{t} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n F_i = \frac{\mathbf{1}^t F}{\mathbf{1}^t \mathbf{1}}$$
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/trend_pbbasicordinary}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Generalised least squares is more appropriate
$$ \displaystyle \hat{t} = \frac{\mathbf{1}^t k(X,X)^{-1} F}{\mathbf{1}^t k(X,X)^{-1} \mathbf{1}}$$
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/trend_estimordinary}
\end{center}
This can be seen as maximum likelihood estimation.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The expression of the \textbf{best predictor} is given by the usual conditioning of a GP:
\begin{equation*}
m(x) = \E[Z(x)|Z(X)=F] = \hat{t} - k(x,X) k(X,X)^{-1} (F - \hat{t}) \vspace{5mm}
\end{equation*} 

Regarding the \textbf{model variance}, it must account for the estimator's variance. 
% We will use the law of total Variance :
% \begin{equation*}
% \Var[X] = \E[\Var(X|Y)] + \Var[\E(X|Y)]
% \end{equation*} 
% If we apply this to the GPR variance prediction we get:
{\small
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\Var[Z(x)|Z(X)] &=  k(x,x) - k(x,X) k(X,X)^{-1} k(X,x)   \\
& \qquad + \frac{(\mathbf{1} + k(x,X)k(X,X)^{-1}\mathbf{1})^t(\mathbf{1} + k(x,X)k(X,X)^{-1}\mathbf{1})}{\mathbf{1}^t k(X,X)^{-1} \mathbf{1}} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*} 
}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
On the previous example we obtain:
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/trend_ko}

\begin{frame}{}
Statistical models are useful when little data is available. they allow to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item interpolate or approximate functions
    \item Compute quantities of interests (such as mean value, optimum, ...)
    \item Get some uncertainty measure
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\structure{Small Recap} We have seen that \vspace{2mm}
\begin{block}{}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Many kernels can be used to build models.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Given some data, there is not one GP model but an infinity...
 \end{itemize} \vspace{2mm}
 \item Kernels encode the prior belief on the function to approximate.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item They should be chosen accordingly
 \end{itemize}\vspace{2mm}
 \item Model/kernel parameters can tuned to the problem at hand \vspace{2mm}
 \item GPR models do not necessarily interpolate. \vspace{2mm}
 \item Model validation is of the utmost importance
 \begin{itemize}
    \item mean \textbf{and} predicted (co-)variance
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Limitations}
The complexity of using kriging models is in building the model
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ for the storage footprint
  \begin{itemize}
    \item storage of the covariance matrix $k(X,X)$
  \end{itemize}
  \item $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for the number of operations
    \begin{itemize}
    \item inversion of the covariance matrix $k(X,X)$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
In practice, the maximum number of observation for classical models lies in the range [1000, 10000].\\
\vspace{5mm}
Another common issue is the numerical stability of the matrix inversion
\begin{itemize}
  \item pseudo-inverse
  \item nugget (or jitter)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Approximation}
We are not always interested in models that interpolate the data. For example, if there is some observation noise: $F = f(X) + \varepsilon$.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Approximation}
\vspace{5mm}
Let $N$ be a process $\mathcal{N}(0,n)$ that represent the observation noise. The expressions of GPR with noise are 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
  m(x) &= \E[Z(x)|Z(X) + N(X) \shorteq F] \\
  &= k(x,X) (k(X,X)+n(X,X))^{-1} F \\ 
  & \\
  c(x,y) &= \Cov[Z(x),Z(y)|Z(X)+ N(X) \shorteq F] \\
  &= k(x,y) - k(x,X) (k(X,X)+n(X,X))^{-1} k(X,y)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Approximation}
We obtain the following model

Influence of observation noise $\tau^2$ (for $n(x,y)=\tau^2 \delta_{x,y}$):

\includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{figures/R/ch34_GPRnoise001} 
\includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{figures/R/ch34_GPRnoise01}\\
The values of $\tau^2$ are respectively 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1.
\end{center}
In practice, $\tau^2$ can be estimated with Maximum Likelihood.
