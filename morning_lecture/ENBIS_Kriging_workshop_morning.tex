\section[Surrogates]{Surrogate models}

\begin{frame}{}
The principle of statistical modelling is to use a few observations to build a mathematical approximation of the function. 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{figures/ink_m}
\end{center}
The model can then be used to answer all previous questions
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
What about \textbf{statistical models}? \\We want to be able to quantify the model error:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/ink_mconfint}
\end{center}
The confidence intervals can be used to obtain a \textbf{measure of uncertainty on the value of interest}.
\end{frame}

There are many kinds of surrogate models:
\begin{columns}[t]

\begin{itemize}
	\item linear regression
	\item polynomial chaos
	% \item wavelets

% We will use the following notations : 
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item The set of observation points will be represented by a $n \times d$ matrix $X=(X_1, ..., X_n)^t$
% 	\item The vector of observations will be denoted by $F$ : $F_i=f(X_i)$ (or $F=f(X)$).

One can distinguish 4 important steps for building a surrogate model :
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Choosing the evaluation points (Design of Experiments)
	\item Evaluating the costly function
	\item Choosing the type of model and estimating its parameters 
	\item Validating the model
	\item Computing the quantity of interest

We will now detail these, with a focus on Kriging models.

\section[Kriging]{Kriging or Gaussian process regression}
%\subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
A random process is similar to a random variable but each draw is a function:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/R/GPR_GaussPrior}
\end{center}
Gaussian processes are particular random processes: $Z$ is a GP if any linear combination of $Z(x_i)$ is normally distributed.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The distribution of a
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Gaussian random variable} is fully described by its \emph{mean (scalar)} and \emph{variance (positive scalar)}.
	\item \textbf{Gaussian vector} (i.e. multivariate normal) is fully described by its \emph{mean vector} and \emph{covariance matrix} (symmetric positive semi-definite matrix).
	\item \textbf{Gaussian process} is fully described by its \emph{mean function} and \emph{covariance function} (or kernel):
	$$ k(x,y) = \Cov[Z(x),Z(y)] $$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The mean of a GP can be any function, but the kernel must satisfy two properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is symmetric: $k(x,y) = k(y,x)$
	\item It is positive semi-definite (psd):
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
	\forall n \in \mathds{N}, \forall x_i \in D, \forall \alpha \in \mathds{R}^n,\  \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j k(x_i,x_j) \geq 0
\end{equation*}
This can be written in a matrix fashion:
\begin{equation*}
	\forall n \in \mathds{N}, \forall X \in D^n, \forall \alpha \in \mathds{R}^n,\  \alpha^t k(X,X) \alpha \geq 0
\end{equation*}
% \vspace{5mm}
Furthermore any symmetric psd function can be seen as the covariance of a Gaussian process. This equivalence is known as the Loeve theorem.
\end{frame}

\begin{exampleblock}{Exercise}
Prove that the following functions are valid covariance functions
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $k(x,y) = 1$
	\item $k(x,y) = \delta_{x=y}$
	\item $k(x,y) = \exp(-(x-y)^2)$

In order to plot sample paths from a GP $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(m(.),k(.,.))$, we will consider samples of the GP discretised on a fine grid.
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{exampleblock}{Exercise: Simulating sample paths}
Let X be a set 100 regularly spaced points over the input space of $Z$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the distribution of $Z(X)$ ?
	\item How to simulate samples from $Z(X)$ ?
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We have observed the function $f$ for a set of points $X = (X_1,\dots,X_n)$:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/R/GPR_obs}
\end{center}
The vector of observations is $F=f(X)$ (ie $F_i = f(X_i)$ ).
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We assume $f$ is a sample from a given GP and we know it interpolates... 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=6cm]{figures/R/GPR_GaussBoth}
\end{center}
What can we say if we combine these two informations?
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We obtain the following \textbf{conditional samples}:

Which can be summarized by a mean function and confidence intervals:

The conditional distribution $Z(x)|Z(X) \shorteq F$ is still Gaussian and it can be computed analytically:\\
\vspace{2mm}
\textbf{mean value}
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		m(x) &= \E[Z(x)|Z(X) \shorteq F] \\
		&= k(x,X) k(X,X)^{-1} F
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\textbf{predicted variance}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    v(x) &= \Var[Z(x)|Z(X) \shorteq F] \\
    &= k(x,x) - k(x,X) k(X,X)^{-1} k(X,x)
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
\textbf{predicted covariance}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    c(x,y) &= \Cov[Z(x),Z(y)|Z(X) \shorteq F] \\
    &= k(x,y) - k(x,X) k(X,X)^{-1} k(X,y)
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $k(x,y) = \Cov[Z(x),Z(y)]$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
A few remarkable properties of GPR models 
\begin{itemize}
  \item They can interpolate the data-points
  \item The prediction variance does not depend on the observations
  \item The mean predictor does not depend on the variance
  \item The mean predictor (usually) comes back to zero when for predictions far away from the observations.

\section{Model validation}
% \subsection{}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
We have seen that given some observations $F=f(X)$, it is very easy to build lots of models, either by changing the kernel parameters or the kernel itself.\\ \vspace{5mm}
The interesting question now is to know how to get a good model. To do so, we will need to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What is a good model?
	\item How to measure it?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The idea is to introduce new data and to compare the model prediction with reality 
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=4.5cm]{figures/R/VALID_testset}
\end{center}
\vspace{3mm}
Since GPR models provide a mean and a covariance structure for the error they both have to be assessed.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Let $X_t$ be the test set and $F_t=f(X_t)$ be the associated observations.\\ \vspace{5mm}
The accuracy of the mean can be measured by computing: 
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\text{Mean Square Error\qquad}& MSE = \mathrm{mean} ((F_t - m(X_t))^2) \\
		\text{A ``normalised'' criterion\qquad}& Q_2 = 1 - \frac{\sum (F_t - m(X_t))^2}{\sum (F_t - \mathrm{mean}(F_t))^2} 
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\\ \ \\
On the above example we get $MSE = 0.038$ and $Q_2 = 0.95$.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
The predicted distribution can be tested by normalising the residuals. \\ \vspace{3mm}
According to the model, $F_t \sim \mathcal{N}(m(X_t),c(X_t,X_t))$.\\ \vspace{3mm}
$c(X_t,X_t)^{-1/2}(F_t-m(X_t)) $ should thus be independents $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/VALID_hist} \qquad
\includegraphics[height=5cm]{figures/R/VALID_qqplot}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
When no test set is available, another option is to consider cross validation methods such as leave-one-out. \\ \vspace{5mm}
The steps are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[1.] build a model based on all observations except one
	\item[2.] compute the model error at this point
\end{enumerate}
This procedure can be repeated for all the design points in order to get a vector of error.\\ \vspace{3mm}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{}
Leave one out often returns worst criteria values copared to test sets... \\
 \vspace{5mm}
We can also look at the residual distribution. For leave-one-out, there is no joint distribution for the residuals so they have to be standardised independently. We obtain:
